Week 2 Project 1 – Time Series &amp; Category Charts using Video Game Sales Dataset

## Project Overview
This project is part of Week 2 – Project 1 and focuses on analyzing a real-world video game sales dataset using time series and category-based visualizations.

The goal of the project is to understand sales trends over time, compare different categories, and visualize sales distribution using appropriate charts.

---

## Objectives
- Plot sales over time using a line chart
- Compare categories using bar charts
- Represent sales share using pie charts
- Save all visualizations as PNG files
- Discuss chart choice and formatting

---

## Dataset
**Video Game Sales Dataset (vgsales.csv)**

The dataset contains information about video game sales across different regions, platforms, genres, and years.

Key columns used:
- `Year`
- `Genre`
- `Platform`
- `Global_Sales`
- `NA_Sales`, `EU_Sales`, `JP_Sales`, `Other_Sales`

---

## Time Series Aggregation
The dataset provides sales information at a **yearly level** and does not include monthly or quarterly date data.  
Therefore, **year-wise aggregation** was used for time series analysis.

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

---

## Visualizations Included
- **Global Sales Trend Over Time** (Line Chart)
- **Genre-wise Sales Comparison** (Bar Chart)
- **Platform Distribution** (Count Plot)
- **Top 10 Best-Selling Video Games** (Bar Chart)
- **Region-wise Sales Share** (Pie Chart)

All charts have been saved as high-resolution PNG files.

---

## Chart Choice & Formatting
- Line charts were used to visualize trends over time.
- Bar charts were used to compare sales across categories.
- Pie charts were used to represent proportional sales share.
- Clear titles, axis labels, rotated tick labels, and professional color schemes were applied to improve readability.

---

## Summary
The analysis shows that video game sales are concentrated in specific years, genres, platforms, and regions.  
This project demonstrates how effective data visualization techniques can be used to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.
